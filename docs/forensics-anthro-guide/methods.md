  * Age estimation by scoring fusion of thoracic and lumbar vertebral centra. Reference population consists of 55 black and white males and females between the ages of 11 and 32 years.  The correlation between stages of union and known age was 0.78 (P < .0001).

* **Berg GE (2008).** Pubic bone age estimation in adult women. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 53(3):569-577.  
  * Age estimation for older females, re-defining the Suchey-Brooks phases V and VI, and adding phase VII. Reference population data derived from Balkan (n = 85) and Eastern Tennessee (n = 104) samples, totaling 189 females.

* **Blankenship JA, Mincer HH, Anderson KM, Woods MA, Burton EL (2007).** Third molar development in the estimation of chronologic age in American Blacks as compared with Whites. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 52(2):428-433.
  * Age estimation of African American populations by scoring third molar development radiographically using the Demirjian et al. stages.  Reference population data derived 637 African Americans between the ages of 14 and 24 compared to 563 American Whites from Demirjian’s prior study. Black–White differences were significant with developmental stages occurring in blacks a year or so earlier than whites. The empirical likelihood that an African American male with fully developed M3's is at least 18 years old is 93% and that for African American female is 84%. Corresponding risks for whites are 90% and 93%.

  * The Suchey-Brooks system is a 6-phase system (I-VI) for age estimation for males and females that utilizes the morphology of the entire symphyseal surface following the six phase system for males described by Katz and Suchey (1986). Reference data are derived from 1,225 individuals of known ages at death from the Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office.

* **Buckberry JL, Chamberlain AT (2002).** Age estimation from the auricular surface of the ilium:  Arevised method.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 119:231-239.  
  * A composite scoring method for ageestimation from the auricular surface. This method is a revision of the existing auricular surface aging method by Lovejoy et al (1985), and scores independent components of the auricular surface, rather than the gestalt. Reference data are derived from a known-age skeletal collection from Christ Church, Spitalfields, London (n = 180).

* **Edgar HJH (2013).** Estimation of ancestry using dental morphological characteristics. Journal of Forensic Sciences 58:S3-S8.2013
  * Ancestry estimation using nonmetric morphological dental traits to distinguish European American, African American, and Hispanic American individuals. The dental traits and scoring definitions are derived from The ASU dental series (see Turner et al. 1991). The reference population includes 509 individuals of Hispanic, African and European ancestry.

  * Ancestry estimation based on nonmetric craniofacial morphology. These data represent a mid-1990s collectiveassessment of observers’ experiences in the field. The variation of twenty-two traits of the skull are compared and described as typical features of American Indian, Black, East Asian, Polynesian, and White populations. The authors state that while all of the presented traits can be useful for ancestry estimation, those of the nose and mouth have shown to be the most useful. The user shouldbe cautious when applying this method as little attention is provided to the underlying distribution of traits among the populations surveyed. Method should be deprecated.

* **Hefner J (2009).** Cranial nonmetric variation and estimating ancestry. Journal of Forensic Sciences, 54(5):985-995.  
  * Provides underlying frequency distributions by ancestry for 11 commonly used cranial nonmetric traits. The reference sample consists of 747 individuals from four skeletal collections, comprised of prehistoric and contemporary individuals, which are separated into an African, Asian, European, and Native American. Ten of the 11 traits examined had frequency distributions with significant differences (p < 0.001) between groups, but the range in variation of these traits, particularly within groups, suggests that ancestry estimation cannot be conducted by visual observation alone.

  * Ancestry estimation using six cranial nonmetric traits to separate American Whites and Blacks. OSSA is anonparametric method that compresses morphological variation into two classes.To employ OSSA, all six non-metric traits are scored using the original character states (original ordinal categories, 0-4), and then compressed to the corresponding dichotomous state (0,1). All six OSSA scores (0-6) are summed. Values of four or greater areclassified as American White; values of three or less are classified as American Black.

  * Age estimation based on the morphology of the sternal end of the fourth rib (White Males). This system is a 9-phase system (0-8), requiring the sternal end of the 4th rib be compared to three-dimensional casts of known age exemplars. The reference population consists of 118 white males of known age at death.

  * Age estimation based on themorphology of the sternal end of the fourth rib (White Females). This system is a 9-phase system (0-8), requiring the sternal end of the 4th rib be compared to three-dimensional casts of known age exemplars. The reference population consists of 86 white females of known age at death.

   * Age estimation of Hispanicpopulations by scoring third molar development radiographically using the method of Demirjian et al. (1973) for crown and root formation. Hispanic individuals (n = 950) aged from 12-22 years were evaluated and the third molar was found to develop 8-18 months faster than American Caucasians as reported by Mincer et al. (1993). Prediction tables for minimum and maximum age for an observed stage are provided.

  * Scattered and commingled human and animal remains are commonly encountered on archaeological sites, and this contextual relationship begs the question of whether human and animals were treated in a similar manner before burial. The recording system presented here provides a means by which to confront problems of equifinality – that is, when taphonomic alterations create apparently similar patterns and, therefore, confuse behavioural inferences drawn from them. This method hinges on a standardised representation of the zones on human skeletal elements that allow comparison with those described by Dobney and Rielly (1988) for animal remains. It is anticipated that the anatomical descriptions in combination with the zone drawings presented will aid others to apply the method generally across skeletal assemblages of any date. This system could also be used to aid the curation of museum collections and as a complement to forensic recovery.

  * Age estimation based on a 3-phase or 5-phase system for medial clavicular fusion for modern American individuals. The reference sample consists of clavicles from 1289 individuals (1044 male, 245 female): 594 individuals (448 male, 146 female) between 11 and 33 years from the William F. McCormick Clavicle Collection, 354 individuals (255 male, 99 female) between 11 and 30 years from the Hamann-Todd Osteological Collection), and 341 males between 16 and 33 years from the Korean War. Due to secular trends, observed ages for each phase are provided separately for each sample. A Bayesian approach is also utilized to provide age ranges from the McCormick sample (for more modern cases).

  * An 8-phase age estimation system based on auricular surface morphology. The reference population was derived from the Todd Collection (n = 500), the Libben Collection (n = 250), and forensic cases from the Cuyahoga County Coroner’s Office, Ohio (n = 14). Two completely blind tests were conducted to assess the accuracy and bias of the new method utilizing different individuals from the Todd Collection (n = 98 and 108, respectively).

  * Age estimation by assessing suture closure of the four maxillary (palatal) sutures. The reference sample consisted of 186 skeletons of known age, sex, and race from three skeletal collections: 46 White males, 32 White females, 64 Black males, and 44 Black females. Males exhibit more suture obliteration than females at the same age. Although this method cannot be used for exact estimates of individual age, it is valuable in establishing an estimated age range.  

* **McKern TW, Stewart TD (1957).** Skeletal Age Changes in Young American Males.  Quartermaster Research and Development Command Technical Report EP-45, Natick, MA. 
  * Age estimation by scoring epiphyseal union of various skeletal elements, as well as morphology of the pubic symphysis. The reference sample consists of American males who died as a result of the Korean War from 1950 to 1952. Because this sample is represented by military males, individuals below 17 years of age are not present, and these methods are most applicable for American males who died prior to (ca.) 1960.
  * *Epiphyseal union:* The stage of epiphyseal union is scored on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 - unfused, 1 - beginning fusion, 2 - largely fused, 3 - fused, 4 - fused with no remnant fusion line).  The stage of epiphyseal fusion can then be compared to the published standards.  McKern and Stewart present only raw data in tabular form.
  * *Pubic symphysis:* The McKern-Stewart system is a 3-component system that scores the dorsal and ventral demifaces and the rim of the pubic symphysis (each component having a 0-5 stage of development). Morphology can be compared to a cast set comprised of a representative pubic symphysis for a score of 1 to 5 for each component.  The scores for each component are combined and correspond to a given age range.

  * Age estimation by scoring (0-open, 1-minimal closure, 2-significant closure, 3-complete obliteration) ectocranial vault and lateral anterior suture closure at ten sites. Scores are combined to produce two composite scores that correspond to estimates of age-at-death, which were found to be independent of race and sex. The reference sample consisted of 236 crania from the Hamann-Todd Collection.

  * Age estimation for American Whites and Blacks by scoring third molar development radiographically using the eight-grade classification system by Demirjian et al. (1973). The reference sample consists of American males (46%) and females (54%) between the ages of 14 and 24 years (n = 823). The sample consisted of white (80%), black (19%), and “other” (1%). Although the third molar is the most variable tooth, the formation of the third molar can be useful for age estimation when other elements are unavailable.

  * Age estimation by scoring ectocranial, endocranial, and maxillary suture closure and provided regression formulae based on observations of American White (n = 49) and Black (n = 51) males and females (n = 50 for each). Twenty-seven cranial landmarks are scored,including 16 from the ectocranial surface, 7 from the endocranial surface, and 4 from the palate, on a scale of 0 to 3. Ten of the ectocranial landmarks are the same as Meindl and Lovejoy’s (1973) landmarks. Scores can be summed and
utilized in a regression equation to predict age. Eight equations for
predicting age from all cranial suture landmarks are provided. Because
incomplete crania are often recovered, additional formulae using only landmarks
of the calotte are also provided (Equations 9 – 15).

Age estimation based on auricular
surface morphology. This method is a modified 6-phase system of the existing
8-phase auricular surface aging method by Lovejoy et al (1985). The sample for
this study consisted of 266 individuals of documented age, sex, and ancestry

Sex estimation based on three
features of the adult os coxa: the ventral arc, subpubic concavity, and the
ischiopubic ramus. A test of 275 Black and White males (n = 180) and females (n

Ancestry estimation based on cranial
morphology (Asian, Black, White). Forty-five cranial and dental traits commonly
used by Mountain, Desert, and Coastal Forensic Anthropologists were assessed
for distinguishing between “American Caucasoid,” “Southwestern Mongoloid,” and
“American Black:” 18 from the braincase, 13 from the face, 7 dental, and 7 from
the mandible. The traits determined to be the most useful in ancestry
assessment are provided for each group. 
 

Rogers TL  (1999).
A visual method of determining the sex of skeletal remains using the distal
humerus.  Journal of Forensic Sciences, 44:57-60.  

Sex
estimation based on the scoring of four dimorphic features of the distal
humerus: trochlear constriction, trochlear asymmetry, olecranon fossa shape and
depth, and the angle of the medial epicondyle. Note:  In ambiguous cases (two traits scored asmale, two traits scored as female), greater weight should be given to the
olecranon fossa.  The greatest accuracy
is achieved when all four features are present and scorable. The technique was
developed on a 20th century anatomy series, the University of Toronto Grant
Skeletal Collection, and was tested on 35 known individuals from the University
of New Mexico Documented Collection and 93 individuals from the William M. Bass
Donated Skeletal Collection.

The rhomboid fossa of the clavicle as a sex and age estimator. 
Journal of Forensic Sciences, 45:61-67.

Sex estimation based on clavicle
morphology, specifically, the presence or absence of the rhomboid fossa.  A rhomboid fossa is defined as a pitted ordepressed marking on the inferior sternal end of the clavicle.  Males are more likely than females to have a
rhomboid fossa, and rhomboid fossa are more commonly exhibited in younger
individuals than older individuals. This method includes posterior
probabilities for the presence/absence of the fossa. This method was derived
from a large contemporary sample (n = 344: 113 females, 231 males).

Age estimation based on features of
the os coxa. This method provides 90% prediction intervals for each combination
of pubic symphysis (scored following the Suchey-Brooks method, n = 376) andauricular surface (scored following the Lovejoy method, n = 448) that they
observed in a combined sample of 18th-century English and 20th-century
Portuguese.  These prediction intervals
have been found to be accurate for 20th-century Americans as well (Passalacqua
2010).  When both scores can be observed
on the same individual, a combined age estimate may be produced in this
manner.  Such a combined age estimate maybe more precise than the pubic symphysis alone, particularly for individuals
whose pubic symphyses are in phases 3-6.

Greater sciatic notch morphology:  Sex,
age, and population differences.  American Journal of Physical Anthropology,
127:385-391.

Provides empirical probabilities of
being male or female for a given sciatic notch score, following Buikstra and
Ubelaker (1994). A score of 1 typically indicates a female, while a score of 3
or greater usually indicates a male.  A
score of 2 represents intermediate morphology, although a larger percentage of
males than females exhibit this degree of expression. There is also a
relationship between age-at-death and sciatic notch score, with younger people
tending to have wider greater sciatic notches. The reference sample consists of
American males and females (n = 114 and 97, respectively) who died between
1915-1955, as well as London males and females (n = 51 and 34, respectively)
who died between 1761-1851.

 

Walker PL (2008).
Sexing skulls using discriminant function analysis of visually assessed traits.  American
Journal of Physical Anthropology, 136:39-50.

Provides empirical probabilities of
being male for a given score of observed cranial morphology following the
ordinal scales presented in Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994).  The sectioning point is 0, and scores less
than 0 are more likely to be male, and scores greater than 0 are more likely to
be female.  The probability distributions
are based on 304 skulls of known sex from European American, African American,
English (British), and 156 Native American individuals.
